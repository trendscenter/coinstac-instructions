Users can download a computation ahead of time by opening COINSTAC and
clicking on Computations in the menu on the left side.

They will see a screen like this:

Â 
For example, for the ENIGMA computation, they should click on the
"DOWNLOAD IMAGE" button under the "ENIGMA in COINSTAC demo" computation.

After that, they will see downloads of the parts of the image starting, as
shown below:

When the download is finished, that DOWNLOAD IMAGE button will say
"REMOVE IMAGE," as shown below. Under no circumstances should an end
user press the "DELETE" button. That button will be removed from the UI
soon.
